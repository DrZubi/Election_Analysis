## 3) Election-Audit Summary: 
The script used for this local congressional election can be modified for other elections in any scale. Modifications would need to be made; for instance, city or state names could be included in the script to provide insight for presidential or federal elections. For larger elections, a breakdown of the different turnouts and votes for each province within a state can be included to help provide candidates better insight for how to adjust their election campaigns.
